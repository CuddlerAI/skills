# Changelog

All notable changes to the Cuddler skills. The version here, `VERSION` and every plugin manifest must match (CI checks).

## [0.3.0] — 2026-10-09

First public version. The numbering continues from the internal 0.2.0 skills, which this repository replaces for everyone outside the Cuddler team.

### Changed

- **The skills use the Cuddler MCP server** (`https://mcp.cuddler.ai/mcp`) instead of the `cuddler` command-line tool, so anyone with a Cuddler account can use them today.
- **The plugin brings the MCP server along.** Installing it on Claude Code or Codex adds both the skills and the connection; signing in happens once, in the browser.
- **`cuddler-setup`** now installs the plugin, signs in through the browser and checks the account. There is no token to copy and no tool to download.
- **Hard rules** rewritten for the MCP tools: one quote and one gate per render, approval links for larger renders, one idempotency key per render, no credentials in the chat.
- Descriptions say when to use each skill instead of summarising its steps.

### Removed

- The prompt-remix skill (rights risk) and every bring-your-own provider key path.
- Every price and credit figure inside the skills: prices come from the tools at runtime.

### Added

- `claims.json`, the one source of every public claim, with `scripts/claims.mjs` to render the README from it.
- `.mcp.json` for the plugin, `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` and `CODEOWNERS`.
- Eval cases in the `claude plugin eval` format, with mocked Cuddler tools so a run spends nothing.
- Validator checks: no command-line instructions, no hard-coded prices, only real Cuddler tool names, README in sync with `claims.json`, `.mcp.json` in sync with `claims.json`, no internal addresses.
- MIT license (trademarks excluded).
